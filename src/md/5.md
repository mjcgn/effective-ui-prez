# Results

## Fully-Integrated Teams
* Increased collaboration
* Collective accountability of products and features
* Design/Engineering owns "How"
* Improved morale and work/life balance

## Measurable Quality
* Continuous improvement (Kaizen) throughout entire organization
* Reduced defects rate by ~85% (~40% to < 5%) on all features and products
* "Move-Left" alerts allow for finding weak points in process

## Predictable & Measurable Cycle-Times
* Scoping and project roadmaps can be built using data, not wild estimates
* More precise resource allocations
* Features can be built in-tandem based on standard deviations in feature sizes
