# Learning Experiences

## Organization
* Buy-in is necessary from the top-down
* Big changes are scary and often unpredictable
* Be prepared for financial or cultural side-effects
* Educating and collaborating with Sales is crucial for success

## Personnel
* Not everybody wants to be a team-player
* Shared accountability can influence and foster _good and bad_ collaboration
* Attitude, stoke, and culture-fit matter more than skill
* Do not make it convenient for individuals to produce without thinking
* People are prone to altruism, but not self-policing

## Process
* Kaizen; always continue to improve and eliminate waste
* Processes/methodologies should not remain static to the organization, team, or project
* If there's data to record, record it
* Include feedback from everyone
